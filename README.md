# 👋 Hi, I’m Allan Ramírez

**Statistician** from the *National University of Colombia* with a Master's in *Analytics* from *Universidad de los Andes*. I build data-informed systems with experience in **credit risk** and **fraud detection**, optimizing pipelines and deploying practical solutions. I enjoy turning messy data into clear insights and building practical tools that help teams to make decisions more reliably.

## 🌟 About Me
- Data-minded problem solver with a background in credit risk & fraud analytics.  
- I work on making data pipelines lean and trustworthy (mostly in SQL/BigQuery) and wrapping them with user-friendly interfaces like Streamlit.  
- I care about clarity: models should be interpretable, pipelines observable, and decisions traceable.  
- Always improving—currently refining predictive regressions and modernizing legacy tools for web use.
